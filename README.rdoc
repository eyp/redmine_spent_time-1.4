<b>Maintenance version for Redmine 1.4.X</b>

This is a {Redmine}[http://www.redmine.org]'s plugin which allow users to add spent time entries for issues they have worked on. 
It gives users a comfortable form to do queries about their spent time on projects, along with a little form
to submit new entries. Of course also it's possible to delete entries and to modify existing ones.

From this functionality a user will be able to add time entries to assigned issues or to issues which he
has already spent some time but are not assigned to him.

== Installation

1. Go to your redmine root path/vendor/plugins.
2. At the command line type 'git clone https://github.com/eyp/redmine_spent_time.git'.
3. Restart your Redmine web servers (e.g. mongrel, thin, mod_rails).
4. Login and configure the plugin (see Permissions section.)
5. Click the 'Spent time' link in the top left menu.

== Usage

It's very easy to use, click the 'Spent time' link in the top left menu, from there you will be able to do queries and add entries.
